## Compostion vs Inheritance

## Composition

## Composition is a pattern we use to target and manipulate one or more Class Components.  We can build Components inside Components and add specific properties to these objects inside of objects as we go along. This pattern can continue indefinitely. This is used in object-oriented programming (OOP). Composition is the cleanest and most preferred practice in writing code.
