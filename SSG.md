## SSG (Static Site Generator)

### This API is used to quicken a websites' initial download time onto the browser by building the Html template during the building process of the website and sending it to the Server.  SSG is used when sites don't have that much change in data and updates are less frequent. These sites have higher scores on Google SEO because of the quick initial time to download the site onto the browser.
