## Formik

### This Library is used to assist us in managing and handling data input fields. We use this API as a template for forms on our pages for example if we require our users to enter their email address and password in order to gain access to their personalized page. Formik assists us by providing templates with Javascript logic that handle the changes on the screen after our users have entered their personal information.
