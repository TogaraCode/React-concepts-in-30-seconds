## Material UI

### We can use this library of Icons and Fonts to style our Apps. These icons add a professional look to our webpages. This UI framework provides us with thousands of icons that are easily added to our Apps to make the User Interface (UI)  look appealing. Icons can be used to indicate the function of buttons on a page like having a shopping basket icon on a page will show the user where to click if they are looking for the Checkout page.
