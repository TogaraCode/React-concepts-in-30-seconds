## React Testing Library

### We can use this Library to test components in our React Apps. This API interacts directly with the DOM and mimics the user experience to give us an idea of how the components will behave on the user's browser. When we make small changes to our components then this library helps us to monitor the updates to the components and we can check their performance with ease.
