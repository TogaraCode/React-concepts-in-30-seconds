## Props vs State

### Props as previously mentioned is an abbreviation of the word properties. We use these as a set of rules we wish to apply to specified objects as initial static arguments. 

### State is used as an argument when we foresee an intended change in data. We use State as a tool to control the change in the component and manage the rendered output.
