## SSR ( Server Side Rendering)

### When we use SSR the initial Html is rendered to the Client as a full page from the Server. This means that the Webpage is downloaded as a whole onto the browser making the start-up time quicker.Â  This allows the App to have a better SEO because Google uses the loading time is a deciding factor. This is usefull when the app has a lot of fast changing data that is personalised like on social media platforms.
