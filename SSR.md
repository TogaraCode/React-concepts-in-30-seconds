## SSR ( Server Side Routing)

### When we use SSR the initial Html is rendered to the client as a full page from the Server. This means that the webpage is downloaded as a whole onto the browser making the start-up time quicker.Â  This allows the App to have a better SEO because Google uses the loading time is a deciding factor.
