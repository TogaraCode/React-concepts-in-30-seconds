## Functional Components

### A Functional Component is a set of rules that we can allocate to a specific region of a website. Its purpose is to return an element onto the screen. Properties(props) are accepted in Functional Components. This means that we can designate specific characteristics, called props or properties to these particular sections. JSX is used to present an argument to manipulate the function of these particular objects and present the desired outcome onto the screen.
