## Lists and Keys

## Lists 

### If we were to over simply React we could describe it as consisting of many lists of items and data inside of lists of items and data like Russian dolls.Lists are commonly rendered inside components.We use the JSX .map() method to combine different types of data to update the DOM.For example, if we had a list of people's names and ages they would be two different types of data, names being words and ages being numbers. To arrange these names and numbers together we use the .map() function to combine these different types of data so that we can present them together in the DOM.

## Keys

###  A Key is used to target and label an item in a list by giving it an ID.We also use keys to monitor changes in specific items in lists.
