## Hooks

### We use hooks to target specific parts of Functional Components. By using hooks we can easily access and connect certain parts of different components by having direct access to every phase in the Components lifecycle.

## useState 

### This hook allows us to control data in components by setting an initial state for every render and being able to target this value and use it for other components. This function uses events and event listeners to update the state.

## useEffect
