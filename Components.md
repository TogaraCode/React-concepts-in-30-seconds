## Components

### We divide websites into reusable parts/sections/regions called Components. This is done so that we can target different sections of the website especially when we would like different parts of the website to serve independent specific purposes. Components are also useful because of their reusable nature allowing us to duplicate sections of the website. For example, if a clothing store has a website and we wanted to display 10 different T-shirts on the page. We could make one component that would have our desired characteristics like a picture and price as a template. Then we could duplicate this Component 9 more times in order to have 10 similar items on the same page with the only difference between the sections of the page being the image and price. Props
