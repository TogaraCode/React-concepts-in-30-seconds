## Unfetch

### This API is used to fulfill promises by allowing us to link other websites to our page on conditions. We use this API to fetch and get objects from other websites and manage how we use these objects on our site. We can create an order in which the objects are rendered onto our screens using promises and responses accordingly. This includes error handling for example.
