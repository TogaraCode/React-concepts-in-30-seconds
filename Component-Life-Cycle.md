## Component Life Cycle

###

### Every component has a life cycle that is divided into three phases.

### The first is the creation phase, called Mounting. 

### The second phase is called Updating.

### The third and last is the deletion phase called Unmounting.

### A method is a function that has its own properties/characteristics.

### React uses methods in the lifecycle called Lifecycle-Methods.
