## Final Form

### This Library is used to efficiently update our webpage according to the information we receive from our users. We use this Library to target the parts of the page that are to be updated according to the information the user has given us while leaving the remaining parts of the page unchanged. If we want to personalize a webpage by presenting the user's name on the screen then we could use this library to do so in an efficient way. Final Form helps us bundle together all the parts of the page that are standard for everybody and it allows us to personalize small parts of the page when users enter data like their name and age for example.
