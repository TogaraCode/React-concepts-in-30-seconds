## Create React App

### Allows you to quickly create and run a React application without any configuration.

### It creates a frontend build template allowing the user to use any backend of choice.

### This toolchain installs all the dependencies needed for a React application run.

### First it is imperative to find out which version of Node has been installed on your machine.

### If we are running a Node version 5.2.0 or later we can run npx create-react-app "my-app-name" in the command line for npm to work.

### npx create-react-app "my-app"

### npx create-react-app will generate a code with a source folder containing numerous files in it as follows:

### App.css

### App.js

### App.test.css

### Index.css

### Index.js

### logo.svg

### registerServiceWorker

### .gitignore

### package.json

### README:md

### Index.js is where the app starts.

### This is where the ReactDom render attaches to the root.

### App.js file contains the react component

### Package.json contains all the react dependencies

### npm start will commence a development server and create a browser instance for the correct url
